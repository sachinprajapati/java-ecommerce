Need update on daily basis 

Deadline - Friday morning India 


Hi,

This is regarding Java assignment on Food Delivery system. Attached the specifications below. 

Basic functions that need to be implemented: 

1. Login/logout - customer, owner, admin 
2. Register customer and owner (admin will be assigned only 1 id and password so no need to register owner)
3. Make order by customer
4. Generate basic receipt after ordering food (item names, prices and quantity)
5. Give rating to food and restaurant after ordering
5. View your past orders by customer
6. Edit Menu by owner - delete/add item
7. Delete customer account only by admin
8. Restaurants and food items can be named anything. No specific names for both. 

NO DATABASE NEEDED. DETAILS CAN BE STORED USING ARRAY OR ARRAYLIST. 
NO GUI NEEDED. 
GET AND SET METHODS ARE COMPULSORY FOR USING PRIVATE ATTRIBUTES. 
Should be plain and simple java application with no colours or background images. 

JAVA based application implemented from Bluej or Eclipse. I have also attached the Java diagram for reference. Name of the application should be MonashEats.



No delete restaurant by owner. Restaurant names can be hard coded

No food and restaurant ratings by customer
